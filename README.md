##Description

Purpose and description of the project so that the person reading your portfolio can understand the project in the first few seconds of reading the project information.

##Tech Stack

Tech stack including the programming languages, libraries and frameworks your project uses (e.g.: Python, React, ...). If you have a front-end application that uses an external public API, please mention this.

##Design
Examples of user interfaces associated with the project. If the project has a user interface, you can insert a GIF, video or image of the user interface.

If it is an application that runs on the terminal, you can create a GIF that shows how to work with it. This is good for giving an idea of how to interact with the application and what someone would see when they run the project.

##Features
If your project has a lot of features, you should add a Features section and list them here.

##How to run the project
Instructions on how to set up, run and use the project. This is good if someone wants to start the project from scratch, they should find everything they need to know in the project's README without needing any help from you.

If it's simple, you can include it in the readme file. You can also refer to another file in your project if the instructions are longer.

You should also host your project e.g. using Netlify, so users can open the deployed app and use it right away to see how it works. (Keep in mind that not every recruiter looking at your GitHub profile has a solid understanding on how to set up a project locally.)
